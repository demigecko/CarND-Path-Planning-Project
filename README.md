Program can be built using default make arguments.

II. Goals 
----------

In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

II. Implementation

A. Though Porcess 

0. Know the Data  

First of all, I would like to know what kind of data structure we have. There are three parts: 

(1) The map waypoints:

All the waypoints are given through a csv file, 

 [waypoints_x, waypoints_y, waypoint_s, waypoint_dx, waypoints_dy] 
- 784.6001 1135.571 0 -0.02359831 -0.9997216
- 815.2679 1134.93 30.6744785308838 -0.01099479 -0.9999396
- 844.6398 1134.911 60.0463714599609 -0.002048373 -0.9999979
- 875.0436 1134.808 90.4504146575928 -0.001847863 -0.9999983

```
// Waypoint map to read from
string map_file_ = "../data/highway_map.csv";
// The max s value before wrapping around the track back to 0
double max_s = 6945.554;

std::ifstream in_map_(map_file_.c_str(), std::ifstream::in);

string line;
while (getline(in_map_, line)) {
  std::istringstream iss(line);
  double x;
  double y;
  float s;
  float d_x;
  float d_y;
  iss >> x;
  iss >> y;
  iss >> s;
  iss >> d_x;
  iss >> d_y;
  map_waypoints_x.push_back(x);
  map_waypoints_y.push_back(y);
  map_waypoints_s.push_back(s);
  map_waypoints_dx.push_back(d_x);
  map_waypoints_dy.push_back(d_y);
  }
```
There is a helpful function called getXY in helper.h for converting the map XY coordinates to Frenet coordinate. I found Frenet is a super useful system that significantly reduces complexity. 

(2) The ego car instant infmoation 

the simultaor feeds the data in every 0.02 seccond. The following is an example: 

```
["telemetry",
{
"d":6.164833,
"end_path_d":0,
"end_path_s":0,
"previous_path_x":[],
"previous_path_y":[],
"s":124.8336,
"sensor_fusion":[[0,775.99,1421.6,0,0,6721.839,-277.6729],[1,775.8,1425.2,0,0,6719.219,-280.1494],[2,775.8,1429,0,0,6716.599,-282.9019],[3,775.8,1432.9,0,0,6713.911,-285.7268],[4,775.8,1436.3,0,0,6711.566,-288.1896],[5,775.8,1441.7,0,0,6661.772,-291.7797],[6,762.1,1421.6,0,0,6711.778,-268.0964],[7,762.1,1425.2,0,0,6709.296,-270.7039],[8,762.1,1429,0,0,6663.543,-273.1828],[9,762.1,1432.9,0,0,6660.444,-275.5511],[10,762.1,1436.3,0,0,6657.743,-277.6157],[11,762.1,1441.7,0,0,6653.453,-280.8947]],
"speed":0,
"x":909.48,
"y":1128.67,
"yaw":0
}]

```

(3) The senor_fusion: 
The format of the senser_fusion at each instant: 
Â [ id, x, y, vx, vy, s, d]

the following is an example: 
```
[[0,1028.527,1157.093,18.73593,7.745808,246.8913,1.986083],[1,848.2643,1124.903,22.25336,-0.04875283,63.70484,9.995473],[2,1060.983,1161.701,16.32937,6.75282,278.5971,10.01214],[3,775.8,1432.9,0,0,6713.911,-285.7268],[4,775.8,1436.3,0,0,6711.566,-288.1896],[5,775.8,1441.7,0,0,6661.772,-291.7797],[6,762.1,1421.6,0,0,6711.778,-268.0964],[7,762.1,1425.2,0,0,6709.296,-270.7039],[8,762.1,1429,0,0,6663.543,-273.1828],[9,762.1,1432.9,0,0,6660.444,-275.5511],[10,762.1,1436.3,0,0,6657.743,-277.6157],[11,762.1,1441.7,0,0,6653.453,-280.8947]]
```
Total, we have 12 (id from 0 to 11) cars on the same side of the highway. I calculate the speed in Frenet coordinates, by ```sqrt(vx*vx+vy*vy)```. Moreover, I classify each of them by three lanes and the distance apart from the ego car, which later will be useful for scenario decision making criteria. I carefully choose to have vectors that record how many vehicles are in the range*. We will discuss the range in the later prt. 

1. Plan the path by adoping spline.h libaray 

- This part, I pretty much follow  Aaron's instruction in Project Q &A. Thanks for providing this session. It makes this project much fun. I like the part we only need to specify the lane = 0, and then the ego car will change lanes automatically. I was amazed by this simplicity. 

2. The concept of making the lane changing in code 
- As I described earlier, I know the location of each car (check_car_s) and its estimated future location (check_car_s1) based on the previous path planning. From the check_car_s, I know the car is in front/rear of the ego car. From the check_car_s1, I know its future location within 50m front /30m rear apart.  
 ![alt text][image1]
 ![alt text][image2]
 
It is important is explain my classification here, especially car_laneX_front and car_laneX_rear. I define the front and rear in the present locatoin that other car is either front and rear of my ego car. In the case of the cars in front of my ego car in the presnet, I add the second condition that  ```abs(check_car_s1 - car_s) < 50```. the check_car_s1 is an estimated location of the car in front in the present, but its velocity could be lower than my ego car, and ego car can passing throught it. so the absolute value is to make sure it was showing up from front. This can help to aviod collision in a situation that a slower car in the ajsent lane and the ego car decideda to pass by and change lane 


3. Avoid accelrateion, Jerk, and change lanes under certian condictions

At the start of the simulator, the ego car is situated in lane = 1, and to accelerate without much jerk, I set the initial velocity to be zero, and it will speed up gradulally. 

```
// if the ego car is in lane = 1 
          // only when the car just start in lane 1   
          if ((lane == 1) && (lane1_clear_rear == false) && (lane1_clear_front == true)) {
              if (ref_vel < 49.5) {
                ref_vel += 0.224;
              }
          } 
          // if there is a car in front of the ego car
          else if (lane == 1 && lane1_clear_front == false) { 
            //slow down first 
            slow_down = true; 
            // check if it is safe of make a lane chane 
            // if the left lane is clear, move to left lane
            if (lane0_clear_front == true && lane0_clear_rear == true) {
              lane = 0;
            } 
            // if left lane is not the option, then check the right lane 
            else if (lane2_clear_front == true && lane2_clear_rear ==true ){
              lane = 2; 
            }
            // if left lane is not ready, then slow down 
            else if (lane0_clear_front == false && lane0_clear_rear == true) {
              ref_vel -= 0.224/2; 
            }  
            // if right lane is not ready, then slow down 
            else if (lane2_clear_front == false && lane2_clear_rear == true) {
              ref_vel -= 0.224/2; 
            }
            else {
              //ref_vel -= 0.224;
              slow_down = true; 
            }
          } 

```
